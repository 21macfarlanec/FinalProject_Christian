			<h2> Counter Strike: Global Offensive </h2>
			<h4> History </h4>
			
			<p> Now for a little bit of history...</p>
			<br>
			<p> In 1999, Counter Strike was released as a mod for Valve's very popular game, Half-Life. 13 years later, Counter Strike: Global Offensive was released in 2012 and is the fourth game in the Counter Strike series. In order, there is:</p>
			<ol>
			<li> Counter Strike </li>
			<li> Condition Zero </li>
			<li> Source </li>
			<li> Global Offensive </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Global Offensive was released by Valve, for PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and PS3. CS:GO runs on the source engine. Most people either love or hate this game, mainly because of the play styles and (the reason people hate it) hit registration. </p>
