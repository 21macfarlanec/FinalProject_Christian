			<h4> Fun Facts </h4>
			<ul>
			
			<li> You cant see your own shadow. </li>
					<br>
			<li> ignoremsg – disables everything </li>
					<br>
			<li> De_train radio plays team fortess 2 theme song. </li>
					<br>
			<li> Chickens will follow you if you press e on them </li>
					<br>
			<li> If you keep the tutorials on, you can locate the bomb in smoke. </li>
					<br>
			<li> Originally, the plan was for CS: GO to feature cross-platform multiplayer between the PC, Mac, and PS3. That would have been the first time a big-name game allowed players to beat the crap out of each other regardless of platform. Ultimately though, Valve removed the PS3 from the picture. </li>
					<br>
			<li> Weapon finishes and other cosmetic items did not arrive until after the game was released. So, players were all equal in terms of weapon aesthetics at the onset and none can say their weapons are way cooler. </li>
					<br>
			<li> You can switch the ingame language to "Pirate English" </li
